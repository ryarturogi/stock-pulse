# Development Prompts
prompts:
  # Next.js 15 Specific
  - "Use Next.js 15 App Router with app/ directory structure."
  - "Leverage React Server Components when possible."
  - "Use Next.js built-in optimizations (Image, Font, etc.)."

  # React 19 Features
  - "Take advantage of React 19 concurrent features."
  - "Use React Compiler optimizations where beneficial."
  - "Implement proper Suspense boundaries."
  - "Use new React 19 hooks when appropriate."
  
  # TypeScript Best Practices
  - "Always include JSDoc for public functions and props."
  - "Use TypeScript strict mode and proper typing."
  - "Define interfaces for all component props."
  - "Use type-safe environment variable access."
  - "Implement proper error types and handling."
  
  # StockPulse TypeScript Requirements (MANDATORY - UPDATED)
  - "ALWAYS import types from '@/core/types' for stock-related functionality."
  - "Use ComponentProps for basic component props with className support."
  - "Use StockStoreState for Zustand store state management."
  - "Use FinnhubStockQuote, WatchedStock, StockOption for stock data."
  - "Use WebSocketStatus, RefreshInterval for connection management."
  - "Use type guards (isString, isNumber, isFinnhubStockQuote) for runtime validation."
  - "Use EventSource | null for WebSocket connections (NEVER any)."
  - "Use NodeJS.Timeout | number | null for timer references."
  - "Use ApiResponse<T> from @/core/types for consistent API responses."
  - "Follow TypeScript strict mode with noImplicitOverride: true."
  - "Use ApiHandler and MiddlewareConfig from @/core/middleware for API routes."
  - "Use validation utilities from @/core/utils/validation for input validation."
  - "Use pagination utilities from @/core/utils/pagination for list endpoints."
  
  # Component Guidelines
  - "Prefer small, focused, single-responsibility components."
  - "Use React.memo for performance optimization when appropriate."
  - "Implement proper loading and error states."
  - "Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA, semantic HTML)."
  - "Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent design tokens."
  
  # StockPulse State Management (Zustand)
  - "Use useStockStore() for all stock-related state."
  - "Use stockService for API calls with built-in request deduplication."
  - "Use ErrorBoundary for error handling throughout the app."
  - "Use localStorage persistence with fallback for SSR compatibility."
  - "Use WebSocket connections with exponential backoff reconnection."
  - "Prefer local state (useState) for simple component state."
  
  # New Component Patterns (Post-Refactor)
  - "Use InfiniteStockSelector for stock selection with infinite loading."
  - "Use StockSearch for comprehensive stock search functionality."
  - "Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility in all selectors."
  - "Use intersection observer for infinite loading patterns."
  - "Implement proper loading states with skeleton components."
  - "Use debounced search with 300ms delay for API calls."
  
  # Performance
  - "Use Next.js Image component for all images."
  - "Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports."
  - "Use React.lazy for component-level code splitting."
  - "Optimize bundle size and monitor Core Web Vitals."
  
  # Architecture
  - "Prefer composition over inheritance."
  - "Use custom hooks for reusable logic."
  - "Implement proper separation of concerns."
  - "Use services/ for API communication logic."
  
  # StockPulse Testing (Jest + RTL + Playwright)
  - "Use jest.config.cjs configuration (not .ts due to ES modules)."
  - "No React imports needed in tests (React 19 JSX transform)."
  - "Test loading states with skeleton components."
  - "Test error states with ErrorBoundary integration."
  - "Test real-time updates and WebSocket connections."
  - "Test responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints."
  - "Mock Finnhub API and WebSocket connections properly."
  - "Use pnpm test for unit tests, pnpm test:e2e for Playwright."
  
  # Security
  - "Never expose API keys or secrets to client-side code."
  - "Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix only for truly public variables."
  - "Implement proper input validation and sanitization."
  - "Use Content Security Policy headers."
  
  # StockPulse API Routes (Finnhub Integration)
  - "Follow existing patterns from /api/quote, /api/stock-symbols, and /api/symbol-search routes."
  - "Use withApiMiddleware() for all API routes with appropriate configuration."
  - "Use withReadOnlyMiddleware() for GET-only endpoints."
  - "Use withValidatedMiddleware() for POST/PUT endpoints with validation."
  - "Use withRateLimitedMiddleware() for public endpoints."
  - "Use AbortSignal.timeout(10000) for external API calls."
  - "Handle Finnhub API rate limiting gracefully with retry logic."
  - "Use proper CORS headers for WebSocket proxy routes."
  - "Validate stock symbols with regex patterns."
  - "Use ApiResponse<T> from @/core/types for consistent responses."
  - "Support stock symbol validation and sanitization."
  - "Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures."
  - "Use pagination utilities for list endpoints."
  
  # Deployment (Vercel)
  - "Configure proper caching strategies."
  - "Use Vercel cron jobs for scheduled tasks."
  - "Implement health check endpoints."
  - "Monitor performance and errors in production."
  - "Leverage Vercel's built-in CI/CD for automatic deployments."
  - "Use Vercel preview deployments for testing features."
